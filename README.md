# __*Michael Olshewski's Responsive Portfolio*__

## __Details About This Assignment__
This is our online portfolio of projects and exemplary homework assignments that we have completed during the course of the coding bootcamp. I redesigned my site using SCSS with the mobile-first mindset. I made most of my own elements with the use of SCSS and used the bootstrap grid system to simplify my project list.
